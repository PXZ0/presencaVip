## About

It is a Java Web project for event management and ticket sales.

## Why?
It was a project created as a grade in the faculty of systems analysis and development I took, so it has a lot of bugs and errors, which will be fixed.

But, this project is part of my personal portfolio, so I want to add improvements, precisely so that it serves this purpose. I am improving my studies and looking for new technologies to remake it the way I would like it to be.
